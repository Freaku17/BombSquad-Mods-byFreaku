# I hope you know Python and have seen Bombsquad's API, avaiable at 
# https://ballistica.net/wiki

# else... its still fine :)


# This mod is *genuinely* for Mobile Modders, 
# in PC you can directly get these Terminal Errors in console.
# but sadly on mobile there's no way to view console.
# We can tho, by following GitHub's Android coding environment
# https://github.com/efroemling/ballistica/wiki/Coding-Environment-(Android)
# but it's long process, additionally around 500mb of data to download
# for Pydroid 3 and it's Pydroid's plugins...
# This is helpful for new Modders (who don't use PC)
# Also I'll ***HIGHLY*** suggest to not use this when other mods are installed
# As a TONS of other mods includes errors (which aren't fixed)
# Rename BombSquad folder to BombSquad1 and make a 
# new BombSquad folder and paste this in that
# and also the mod you're working on....
# Happy coding! üî•

# Dont worry about those currency mods or similar stuffs...
# Their data is still stored on app so whenever you use them back 
# (deleting BombSquad folder and renaming BombSquad1 back to BombSquad)
# All currency/data will still be avaiable!!



#AndroidModdersRock
# Btw I'll probably edit/add new things if you would like, I'm also currently learning Bombsquad modding stuffs!!
'''

# ----- For beginners -----
'''
# You should have Custom Scripts mod
# https://youtu.be/z4IvcyWQqsw
# and you should also view other mods file (if you don't have, you can get some mods from same channel)
# and a Code Editor app (on Play Store)'''

# ----- Fixing errors... -----
'''
# Incase you haven't ever seen console:
# The logs.txt shows full stuff ...
# Like say you made a mod but in logs you'll see even file paths of in-game files. Example:'''

# Over here you should ignore in-game files and just see Exception/Traceback (or the path where your mod file is named)
# and bottom lines (to know what error is it exactly)

# Additionally, errors like
# - Invalid Syntax (if you use code editor just press 3 dots and off word wrap, so you can scroll left/right so you can see the ^ arrow pointing correctly) This error is either cuz of some brackets opened but not closed or the other way around. Could also be if you put = instead of ==
# - Indentation error (this is related to spaces, Google can help/explain you in this...)
# - etc etc (take help of Google ü§ê)

# Sometimes you can't just solve it yourself, so you need to ask someone for help
# I would suggest this lovely discord server,
